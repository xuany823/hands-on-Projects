# hands-on-Projects
I have completed multiple end-to-end data science projects that span classification modeling, exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, and machine learning workflows. These projects emphasize hands-on application of Python, R, SQL, and key libraries and were designed to solve real-world problems across industries.
