# Hands-on-Projects
I have completed multiple end-to-end data science projects that span classification modeling, exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, and machine learning workflows. These projects emphasize hands-on application of Python, R, SQL, and key libraries and were designed to solve real-world problems across industries.
  
### Vehicle Characteristics and CO₂ Emissions Analysis (ADS500A)
 Performed exploratory and regression analysis using DOE vehicle dataset (43K rows, 54 features). Found strong correlations between emissions and engine displacement, fuel type, and vehicle volume. Used chi-square and multiple regression to inform sustainable vehicle design and consumer education.
  
### Online Shopper Intention & Revenue Prediction  (ADS500B)
 Conducted EDA and feature engineering on an e-commerce behavior dataset (12K+ sessions). Cleaned and transformed behavioral variables like session duration and bounce rates. Built classification models to predict session revenue and proposed actionable business insights to increase conversions.  
  
### California Housing Price Modeling (Regression)  (ADS501)
 Explored the 1990 California census dataset to predict median house values using Random Forest, XGBoost, and Linear Regression. Evaluated RMSE across models and connected findings to Zillow’s “Zestimate” feature to propose model improvement strategies.   
   
### Entrepreneurship Prediction Using Education & Career Data (ADS502)
 Used a Kaggle dataset (5,000 rows, 20 variables) to predict hidden entrepreneurial potential beyond GPA. Applied SMOTE and built classification models including XGBoost and Naive Bayes. Achieved 79% accuracy and 97% recall, balancing model performance vs interpretability.  
  
### Diabetes Risk Prediction (70K+ records, 22 features)  (ADS503)
Developed and evaluated 14 classification models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Neural Network, etc.) using BRFSS health survey data. Engineered features like metabolic syndrome and composite health risk scores. Performed ROC-AUC optimization and feature reduction through correlation and random forest-based importance analysis.   

### Retail Banking Term Deposit Response Modeling  (ADS504)
 Built ML pipelines using XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks to predict customer responses from a Portuguese bank campaign dataset (41K records). Addressed severe class imbalance (12% positive class) using SMOTE and refined features using Cramér’s V, PCA, and Chi-square tests.
